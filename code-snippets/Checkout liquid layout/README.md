# Shopify Checkout Liquid Layout

The checkout layout is a file used by Shopify Plus merchants. If you're curious about the contents of the file, here it is. 

Please note that adding this file to a non-plus store won't enable it. Plus merchants also need to have the feature enabled before they can use it.
